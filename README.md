# mobile_drawing_app

As this is an academic project for a CS course at the University of Utah, I do not feel comfortable sharing the code in its entirety.

Android drawing app built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Firebase. Users can log in, create/edit drawings, and share these drawings for other users to edit.
